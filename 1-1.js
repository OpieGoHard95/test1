// Defines the variable i and sets it's value to 22
var i = 22;

// Runs a test to see if i is less than or equal to 40
if (i <= 40)

// Sets i's value to a message if it was less than or equal to 40
  i = "i was less than less than or equal to 40!";

// Prints out i with either the value 22 or the message depending on the if
console.log(i);
