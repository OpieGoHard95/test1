var foo = 22;
// Defines a variable foo and gives it the value of 22

var change = function() {
	var foo = "not 22";
// Creates a function that creates a new variable named foo and assigns it a
// different value


console.log(foo);
// Calls a print of foo which demonstrates scope because foo doesn't change
